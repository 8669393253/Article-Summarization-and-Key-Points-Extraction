# Article-Summarization-and-Key-Points-Extraction
This project provides two Python scripts for processing articles from URLs. The first script extracts key points from an article using the spaCy and pytextrank libraries, and the second script summarizes the article using the transformers library with a pre-trained model. Both scripts rely on the newspaper3k library to fetch the article content.
